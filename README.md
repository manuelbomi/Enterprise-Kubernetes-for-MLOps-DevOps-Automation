# Enterprise Kubernetes for MLOps and DevOps Automation

# 🚀 Enterprise Kubernetes for MLOps & DevOps Automation

This guide provides a **hands-on walkthrough** of how Kubernetes works — from simple YAML deployments to real-world **DevOps and MLOps enterprise use cases**.  
It is written to help **junior engineers** and **enterprise practitioners** understand not just *what Kubernetes is*, but *how it fits into scalable production pipelines*.

## 🧩 OVERVIEW

We’ll explore:
1. What Kubernetes does and how it works.  
2. How YAML files define deployments and services.  
3. How to run a simple **NGINX web app** locally using **Minikube**.  
4. How this concept extends into **MLOps pipelines** and **DevOps CI/CD automation**.

## 🧠 WHAT IS KUBERNETES?

Kubernetes (or **K8s**) is an **orchestration system** for automating:
- Deployment  
- Scaling  
- Management of containerized applications  

It ensures your applications:
- Run reliably even if some servers fail.  
- Automatically scale based on demand.  
- Are easy to roll out, update, and monitor.

Think of Kubernetes as a **smart data center manager** — you tell it *what you want* (via YAML files), and it figures out *how to make it happen*.

## ⚙️ WHAT IS A YAML FILE IN KUBERNETES?

A **YAML file** defines the *desired state* of your system.

Example:
- “I want 2 replicas of my web app.”
- “Expose it on port 80.”
- “Use the nginx image.”

Kubernetes reads this YAML and makes sure reality matches what you declared.

## 🧱 HOW DOES KUBERNETES RUN?

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Cluster** | The entire Kubernetes system (control plane + worker nodes). |
| **Node** | A machine (VM or physical) that runs your app containers. |
| **Pod** | The smallest deployable unit; wraps one or more containers. |
| **Deployment** | Manages a set of pods; ensures correct replicas are running. |
| **Service** | Provides networking and load balancing for pods. |

You don’t manually start containers — Kubernetes does it for you once you apply your YAML.

## 🧰 INSTALLING KUBERNETES LOCALLY (VIA MINIKUBE)

To run Kubernetes on your own computer, install **Minikube**.  
It creates a local Kubernetes cluster with one control plane and one worker node.

### 🪟 Windows
```bash
choco install minikube kubectl
