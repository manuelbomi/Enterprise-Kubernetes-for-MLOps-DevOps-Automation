##  1. What Kubernetes *Is*

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as **K8s**) is an **orchestration platform** for containers.

> You have multiple containers (Docker images) that you want to run reliably across several machines (called nodes). Kubernetes is the *manager* that ensures they stay healthy, available, and scalable.

### Kubernetes handles:
- Container **scheduling** and **placement**
- Starting your containers (called pods in Kubernetes)
- **Self-healing** (restarts crashed containers)
- **Scaling** (up/down automatically)
- **Load balancing** (distributing the containers across several servers)
- **Networking** between services
- **Rolling updates** without downtime

---

##  2. What a Kubernetes Cluster Is

A Kubernetes **cluster** is made up of two main parts:

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Control Plane** | The *brain* that makes global decisions (scheduling, scaling, etc.). |
| **Worker Nodes** | The *muscles* that actually run your containers. |

Think of it as:
> Control Plane = Manager  
> Worker Nodes = Employees doing the actual work

---

##  3. What the YAML Files Do

Kubernetes uses **YAML files** as blueprints to describe what you want it to create or manage. YAML files essentially tells Kubernetes what you want it to do.

These are **declarative** ‚Äî meaning you describe the *desired state*, and Kubernetes figures out *how* to do or reach it.

---

###  Example: Simple Deployment YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-webapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: webapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: webapp
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

#### When you run:

```python
kubectl apply -f my-webapp.yaml
```

You are essentailly saying:

‚ÄúHey Kubernetes, I want three containers running nginx, listening on port 80.‚Äù

Then Kubernetes:

- Schedules 3 pods on the available worker nodes.

- Monitors them to make sure they‚Äôre running.

- Restarts them if they crash.

- Balances them across the cluster.

So yes ‚Äî it‚Äôs the YAML file that defines what pods, services, and deployments should exist, but Kubernetes itself is the system that brings them to life.
--- 

## 4. Do You Need to Install Kubernetes Before Writing YAML?

##### You can write YAML files anytime (they‚Äôre just text), but to execute them, you need a running Kubernetes cluster.

# Options for Clusters

| Type        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Local**   | Use Minikube or Kind for testing/development. |
| **Cloud**   | Use Google GKE, AWS EKS, or Azure AKS for production. |
| **Self-hosted** | Deploy and manage your own Kubernetes cluster on-premises or on cloud VMs. |

### Example (Minikube)

# Install Minikube

```python
brew install minikube kubectl   # macOS


choco install minikube kubectl  # Windows

# Start a cluster
minikube start

```

---

## 5. What Happens When You Deploy YAML

##### When you apply a YAML file with:

```python
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

```

##### Here‚Äôs the behind-the-scenes workflow:

- kubectl talks to the API Server (control plane).

- The API server stores your configuration (desired state).

- The Controller Manager compares desired vs. actual state.

- If differences exist, the Scheduler assigns pods to nodes.

- The Kubelet on each node pulls the image and starts the container.

##### Kubernetes constantly ensures that the actual state matches the desired state you declared in your YAML.

---

## 6. Key YAML Object Types You Will See

# Kubernetes Objects

| Object | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Pod** | Smallest deployable unit ‚Äî runs one or more containers. |
| **Deployment** | Manages identical pods, keeps them running. |
| **Service** | Exposes pods to internal/external traffic. |
| **ConfigMap** | Stores configuration data. |
| **Secret** | Stores sensitive information (tokens, passwords). |
| **Ingress** | Routes external HTTP/S traffic to your services. |
| **Job / CronJob** | Run one-time or scheduled tasks. |

## 7. Kubernetes in DevOps

##### Kubernetes is a core building block in DevOps pipelines.

### üîπ Example Workflow:

- Developer pushes code ‚Üí triggers CI pipeline.

- CI pipeline builds a Docker image and pushes it to a registry.

- CD pipeline updates a Kubernetes Deployment via YAML.

- Kubernetes rolls out new pods zero-downtime.

### üîπ DevOps YAML Example ‚Äî CI/CD Deployment

```python
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: backend-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: backend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: backend
        image: mycompany/backend:1.0.5
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

##### This YAML would be automatically updated by Jenkins, ArgoCD, or GitHub Actions whenever a new image tag (1.0.6, 1.0.7, etc.) is built.

##### Kubernetes handles rolling updates gracefully, ensuring no downtime.

---

## 8. Kubernetes in MLOps

#### Kubernetes enables scalable, reproducible ML workflows by orchestrating:

- Training jobs

- Model serving

- Data preprocessing

- Batch inference

- Monitoring


### üîπ Example: ML Model Training Job

```python
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: train-iris-model
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: trainer
        image: myregistry/ml-train:latest
        command: ["python", "train.py"]
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "4"
            memory: "8Gi"
      restartPolicy: Never
```

#### This YAML:

- Runs a one-time ML training task (train.py).

- Uses Kubernetes‚Äô job management to ensure completion.

- Can be scaled horizontally for distributed training (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).

### üîπ Example: Model Serving Deployment (using FastAPI)

```python
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: iris-model-server
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: iris-model
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: iris-model
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: model-server
        image: myregistry/iris-serving:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8000
```

#### This deployment:

- Serves a trained ML model (FastAPI or Flask REST endpoint).

- Can be autoscaled based on CPU/traffic.

- Fits seamlessly into an MLOps pipeline using Kubeflow, ZenML, or MLflow.

## 9. Hands-On Example ‚Äî Deploy NGINX Locally

#### Now let us walk through a complete example locally using Minikube.

### Step 1: Start Minikube

```python
minikube start
```

### Step 2: Create Deployment YAML

##### Create nginx-deployment.yaml:

```python
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Step 3: Create Service YAML

##### Create nginx-service.yaml:

```python
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30001
```

### Step 4: Deploy

```python

kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml

kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml

```

### Step 5: Verify

```python

kubectl get pods

kubectl get svc

```

### Step 6: Access App

```python

minikube service nginx-service

```

Visit:

```python
http://127.0.0.1:30001

```

You should see the default NGINX welcome page.

### Step 7: Clean Up

```python

kubectl delete -f nginx-deployment.yaml

kubectl delete -f nginx-service.yaml

minikube stop
```

### Next Step (Optional)

##### Extend this demo with Auto-Scaling:

```python
kubectl autoscale deployment nginx-deployment --cpu-percent=70 --min=2 --max=5
```

# Final Mental Model

| Concept | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Cluster** | Minikube, EKS, AKS |
| **Deployment** | Manages pods for your app |
| **Service** | Exposes pods to users |
| **YAML** | Blueprint of what you want |
| **kubectl apply** | Command to create/update resources |
| **Pods** | Running containers inside Kubernetes |
| **Kubelets** | Download Docker images and run containers |
